        <h2>Application/Software Developer</h2>
        Hello there! I'm Asisipho Mbobo, a qualified Application developer. I hold a Diploma and an Advanced Diploma in ICT Applications Development and my interest in continious learning led me to participating in the FNB App Academy 2025. This portfolio showcases my journey through the bootcamp, highlighting the skills I've learned and the projects I've completed.

        Those skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, API's, App marketing and many more. I have a passion for creating user-friendly applications and continuously improving my coding skills. This portfolio is a testament to my dedication and growth as a developer.
